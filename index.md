# Ulendo HC

These site provides an overview of the Heat Compensation Plugin Developed by Ulendo. 

## Heat Compensation by Ulendo
This heat compensation plugin is a part of the *compensation-based* technologies for additive manufacturing being developed by the Ulendo team. The heat compensation plugin is targetted specifically towards the optimizing the performance of Laser Power Bed Fusion (LPBF) machines.

What does the Ulendo Heat Compensation Plugin Do?
The Ulendo Heat compensation plugin is designed to help reduce residual stress, and the resulting part deformation that can result from heat stress. In certain limited benchmarks, HC was able to reduce the heat stress and residual stress by up to 90% for certain geometries. 

Who is the Ulendo Heat Compensation plugin targetted to?
This plugin is specifically developed to be integrated with the makers of Slicing software for LBPF machines, or companies that develop the real-time components for LBPF printing.

You can read more about the performancee of smartScan through technical papers available here:

- Generalized SmartScan: An Intelligent LPBF Scan Sequence Optimization Approach for 3D Part Geometries by Chuan He, Bircan Bugdayci, Chinedum Okwudire. doi: 10.20944/preprints202311.0153.v1

The Ulendo Heat Compensation plugin is based on the algorthim developed by Chuan He at the University of Michigan's Sustainable Automation Laboraty.
