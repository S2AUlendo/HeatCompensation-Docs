# Ulendo HC

These site provides an overview of the Heat Compensation Plugin Developed by Ulendo. 

## Heat Compensation by Ulendo
This heat compensation plugin is a part of the *compensation-based* technologies for additive manufacturing being developed by the Ulendo team. The heat compensation plugin is targeted specifically towards the optimizing the performance of Laser Power Bed Fusion (LPBF) machines.

Parts produced by LPBF are prone to residual stress, deformation, cracks and other quality defects due to uneven temperature distribution during the LPBF process. To address this issue, Ulendo has developed a new Heat Compensation Plugin (HC), which provides a method for determining laser scan sequence in LPBF using a model-based and optimization-driven approach, rather than using heuristics. 

This site provides an overview of how this the HC plugin can be integrated and used to optimize arbitrary 3D geometries

### What does the Ulendo Heat Compensation Plugin Do?
The Ulendo Heat compensation plugin is designed to help reduce residual stress, and the resulting part deformation that can result from heat stress. In certain limited benchmarks, HC was able to reduce the heat stress and residual stress by up to 90% for certain geometries. 

### Who is the Ulendo Heat Compensation plugin targeted to?
This plugin is specifically developed to be integrated with the makers of Slicing software for LBPF machines, or companies that develop the real-time components for LBPF printing.

The Ulendo Heat Compensation plugin is based on the algorithm developed by Chuan He at the University of Michigan's Sustainable Automation Laboraty.
