If you chose the default installation location, it will be available in the "C:\Program Files\UlendoHC\examples\" folder. 

This folder contains examples which are compatible for some of the major revisions of the Dyndrite software. Select the folder that contains the version nearest your current installation version.

For ease of use you can open these examples directly from your favorite python editor. The most recent folder indicates the most recent version of the Dyndrite software against which the updates have been tested.
