# Ulendo HC Results
This section provides an overview of some of the early results shown by when optimizing parts using UlendoHC. 

The image below show a comparison of a part printed on the same machine using Stainless steel 316L. 

When printing with Ulendo HC the part prints successfully. However, when printing without the optimized sequence the build fails.

In other independent tests, this part proved to be a useful benchmark when comparing the performance of different slicers. This benchmark shows the clear potential of UlendoHC to be use to address some of the common failures in LPBF machines.
